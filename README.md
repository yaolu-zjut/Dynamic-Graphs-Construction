# Dynamic-Graphs-Construction
Official Codes for Graph Modularity:Towards Understanding the Cross-Layer Transition of Feature Representations in Deep Neural Networks.

We give an example to understand the dynamic graphs:
we leverage pretrained ResNet18 (Top1 acc: 94.78%) on CIFAR-10 to extract feature representations. Then we set N = 50, k = 3 for dynamic graphs construction. The result is shown in the gif below:
